"[""Based on existing literature and clinical guidelines, I can provide you with the answer.\n\nAccording to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) does not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days in patients presenting to an emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock when compared to usual care.\n\nThe study, which pooled data from multiple randomized controlled trials, found that EGDT did not result in a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83-1.06).

"['Based on the available evidence and guidelines, I can provide an answer to your question.\n\nThe use of corticosteroids, specifically low-dose hydrocortisone, has been studied in critically ill patients with septic shock. The goal is to determine whether this therapy improves survival rates and reduces mortality.\n\nAccording to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Annane et al., ""Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the identification and treatment of sepsis""), low-dose hydrocortisone therapy has been shown to improve survival in critically ill patients with septic shock. This is based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that demonstrated improved outcomes among patients receiving corticosteroids compared to those who received a placebo.\n\nHowever, more recent studies have provided mixed results. Some studies suggest that the benefits of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy may be limited or variable depending on the population being studied and the criteria used to define septic shock. For example, a 2018 study published in JAMA (Sprung et al., ""Hydrocortisone for Early Septic Shock"") reported no significant difference in survival between patients receiving low-dose hydrocortisone and those who received placebo.\n\nIn summary, based on the available evidence and guidelines:\n\n**Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy may improve survival among critically ill patients with septic shock**, particularly when used as part of a comprehensive treatment approach that includes other interventions aimed at managing sepsis. However, more recent studies have reported mixed results, highlighting the need for further research to fully understand the benefits and limitations of corticosteroid therapy in this context.\n\nPlease note that these findings are based on existing research and should not be taken as personalized medical advice.
