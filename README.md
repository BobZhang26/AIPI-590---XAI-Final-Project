# **XAI: Knowledge Graph Visualization of GraphRAG Model**
## **Introduction**
The demand for transparency and trust in decision-making processes has become
paramount. This is particularly critical in high-stakes domains such as **healthcare** and
**critical care**, where AI-driven decisions directly impact patient outcomes. Recent AI
models such as **GraphRAG** integrate powerful neural network architectures like
transformers with graph-based retrieval and reasoning mechanisms. But the lack of
inherent explainability raises concerns about how physicians and healthcare
professionals can interpret its decisions.

> This project aims to bridge this gap by enhancing the explainability of GraphRAG through the implementation of a visualization method that allows users to explore the underlying knowledge graph. By enabling interaction with the graph's entities and relationships, this approach provides insight into the model's retrieval mechanisms, fostering greater transparency and trust in its decision-making process.
